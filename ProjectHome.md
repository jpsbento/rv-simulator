Research software that creates a radial velocity light curve based on stellar intrinsic oscillation information. It then perturbs the velocity curve with noise and adds planet signal and attempts to recover the original known information.

This code can be used to gauge the impact of realistic sampling and radial velocity noise in the context of asteroseismology and planet finding observations and detection.
